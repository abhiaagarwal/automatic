        Please follow these guidelines when creating an issue:  
        - If issue is related to ModernUI, create issue at [ModernUI issues](https://github.com/BinaryQuantumSoul/sdnext-modernui/issues)
        - If possible update to latest version before reporting the issue as older versions cannot be properly supported  
          And search existing **issues** and **discussions** before creating a new one  
        - If issue cannot be clearly seen in the provided log, run SD.Next with debug logging enabled by adding `--debug` to your command line parameters
        - If issue is setup, installation or startup related, please check `sdnext.log` before reporting  
          And if possible, perform reinstallation of required dependencies by running SD.Next with `--reinstall` command line flag  
        - If issue is after recent update of SD.Next, try to reproduce it using clean installation to avoid issues due to old configuration  
        - If you have additional extensions installed, try to reproduce the issue with user extensions disabled  
          And if the issue is with compatibility with specific extension, mark it as such when creating the issue  
          Try running with `--safe` command line flag with disables loading of user-installed extensions  
        - If issue is in functionality marked as *experimental* or relates to *dev* branch, reach out on Discord before creating an issue  
          To see which issues are new/updated/experimental, check [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
